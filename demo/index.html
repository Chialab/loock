                When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party
                of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. Twelve more years passed. Each year
                the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that
                something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a
                rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130);
                and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
                Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance
                and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and
                it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels
                stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel
                at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at
                fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the mark.
                There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that
                anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. ‘It will
                have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!’
            </p>
            <p tabindex="0">
                But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him
                his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the
                Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.
                But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up. The eldest of these, and
                Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and
                brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed.

                Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,’ said
                Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo
                was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of
                age at thirty-three.
